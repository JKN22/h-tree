# H-Tree
The H tree is a fractal tree structure made up of segments of perpendicular lines that are each smaller than their larger adjacent neighbor by a factor of square root of 2. It gets its name from the way its repeating pattern looks like the letter "H." It approaches every point in a rectangle arbitrarily closely and has Hausdorff dimension 2. Microwave engineering and VLSI design are two of its uses.
